This is Tom's Simple Chess Program. This chess program was originally
written by Tom Kerrigan (kerrigan@frii.com). It was deliberately
written to be simple and easy to understand.

This version of TSCP was put together by me in March 1998. I added the
RoboFICS support code and the algebraic parse code. I'm providing this
source as an example chess program. If you base your chess program on
any of this code then please give credit to Tom.

The startfics script is provided as a demonstration of how tscp can be
used with RoboFICS.
